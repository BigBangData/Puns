Sharon Miller, a prominent local architect, had been designing a beautiful stone porch for her mansion for several years. 
The process was racked with indecision, with changes to the design and materials coming nearly every week. 
At one point, she'd even ordered fifteen tons of a beautiful (and surprisingly inexpensive) shale to build the structure, 
which she paid for in full at the time, only to realize upon delivery that the stones, although gorgeous, were just too wide, 
which she felt didn't perfectly capture the beauty of her intricate design.
So she put a tarp over the stone and went back to the quarry, eventually settling on an astronomically expensive figured marble, 
planning to buy on credit and hoping that an upcoming job in Tuscaloosa would pay her enough to cover the cost. 
But then, as the train to Tuscaloosa left the station, and while she was on the phone with her stonemason, 
she got a text message telling her that her design had been rejected.
And so it was that later, as Ms Miller rode the rails, that her porch, at first quite costly, used the wider, paid-off shale.
